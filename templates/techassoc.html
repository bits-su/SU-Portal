                    <p class="align-left">We are all intrigued by flight, by what causes it, and are often elated by seeing the elegance of flight. Be it a 747, or a paper plane thrown in class, there is something about it that just makes us happy. This new club aims to bring flight to every BITSian, and give them a chance to design, from scratch, their own airplanes, quadcopters, co-axial and spherical drones, and basically anything that flies. The club is equipped and will equip you so that you make flight your own, and experience the elation for yourself.<br>
                            The members go through the physics, the math, the design, and the stories that came with it, work with electronics and codes. So branch is definitely no bar, if you can feel the joy of flight, you are welcome.<br>
                            Come, let's fly.

                    <p class="align-left">The members of the Automation and Robotics Club are devotees. And their religion is robotics.<br>
                            Robotics is a versatile field which is highly interdisciplinary. Even small projects involve coding, mechanical, electronics and design expertise, which means the members always work in teams and all the projects are group projects.<br>
                            The club’s belief lies in being jacks of all trades instead of trying to be limited to one field, which enables anyone to work on individual interests too.<br>
                            Current projects include autonomous applications like chess-playing using AI, autonomous drawing robot and fields like self-navigation and self-balancing.<br>
                            Also, the club proudly boasts of a full scale robotic arm and a self developed micro-quadcopter, developed from scratch.

The primary aim of the association is to inculcate and nurture an interest in the economics and finance world among all students on campus, not just those studying economics. Towards this end, various events are held, both as part of ATMOS, as well as in general. Events conducted during ATMOS include Courtroom - the headliner event you'll soon come to know about, and a business quiz conducted in collaboration with the quiz club, among others. In addition to this, there are several guest talks and workshops conducted throughout the year by some of the best names in the field of finance in the country and abroad.

However, the PHoEnix office, from day one, has taken this challenge very positively and has remained unfaltering in this endeavour ever since.<br>
                                    The PHoEnix association conducts workshops( line follower, quadcopter, homo-automation,etc) and helps to visualize  a different  perspective of how electronics could solve real life problems which people can’t gain the knowledge from the classes and encourages people to participate in different technical fests all over India. PHoEnix association is famous for its accomplishments and efforts.  Workshops conducted are not restricted to any particular branch and gives platform for everyone to develop and enhance their skills in the field of robotics. It acts a like a Bridge of communication between the faculty and the student body. It always puts efforts in educating students about the current events and activities happening via talks and Newsletters. Placement talk is one famous among them.

                                        When BPHC took its first breath in 2008, it was the Chemistry Department that started the Chemistry Association ‘Alchemy’, the first association of campus. The significance of the name is rooted in all the works that it has done till yet. Our first Director, Dr. V.S. Rao was from Chemistry Department itself!
                                        Coming to the works that the association does, it is the only association that publishes biweekly newsletter ‘Chemazine’ regularly. It also publishes semseter magazine ‘Elixir’ which contains some stuff that can literally amaze you like nothing else. In our techno-management fest, ATMOS, it conducts many events that pull attention like a concert. With the headliner ‘ Chem –Hunt’ and fun filled filler events, the association promises to lighten up your information and mood this ATMOS , just like we do it every year; but this year it’s going to be more than magic. Stay bonded!
