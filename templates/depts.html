Firewallz’s responsibilities other than the above include organizing the inauguration ceremony of ARENA, tracking of losses and damage accurately by handling inventory with utmost caution, scheduling games and matches, verification of details, setting rules and regulations for everyone to follow, etc. The smooth sailing fest happens only because of the ardent cooperation of the department of firewallz and hence it got its title as the backbone of ARENA.</p>
